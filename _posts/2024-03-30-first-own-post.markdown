Welcome to the very first post of this humble blog.
Together, we will deep dive into a wonderful world of SQL.

P.S. Yes, I used to hate calling SQL 'sequel', but in the end it was a nice available domain name.

{% highlight sql %}
-- To give you some flavour:
SELECT 'Hello World!'
FROM yet_another_blog
WHERE year = 2024;
{% endhighlight %}

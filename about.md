Dear visitor,

This blog is a collection of SQL related thoughts, notes and puzzles, which can serve in educational and (hopefully) useful purposes.

I have been working with data for many years, and if I can point out one single skill being crucial for your career in data, it would be sequel.

So please make yourself comfortable at my blog!

Warm regards, \
